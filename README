Common Lisp Quick Reference is a free (see file COPYING) booklet with
short descriptions of the thousand or so symbols defined in the ANSI
standard.


It builds well on a Debian system with the packages texlive-metapost,
texlive-latex-recommended, texlive-latex-extra, and their dependencies
installed.

On FreeBSD, (at least) ports gmake and texlive-full are required.

If you have those dependencies in place, type

  $ make

and be patient.


If you end up with three blank pages at the end you can try to blank a
fourth page by changing

  \renewcommand{\clearpagebeforeindex}{\clearpage}

to

  \renewcommand{\clearpagebeforeindex}{}

in file paper-<your-papersize>.tex.
